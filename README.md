Problem Statement:
Educational organization with different academies in different places.
IT company in that organization wants an utility that could help them in retrieving systems to a desired location that has issues. They are looking
to get the following insights using the app:
1. The distance along certain routes.
2. The number of different routes between two academies.
3. The shortest route between two academies.

I am using Dijkstra algorithm to solve these and nodes here are treated as academies.

More info in the Readme.Docx uploaded in root folder.

The Console App helps users to provide various insights on different routes between academies

Running console App:

Navigate to TeacherComputerRetrieval folder and run "dotnet run" command to build and run the project

Running Tests Project:

Navigate to TeacherComputerRetrieval.Tests and run "dotnet test" command to build and run the tests.
